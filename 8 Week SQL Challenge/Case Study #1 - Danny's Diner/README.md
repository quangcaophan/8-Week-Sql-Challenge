## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:

### **```sales```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The sales table captures all ```customer_id``` level purchases with an corresponding ```order_date``` and ```product_id``` information for when and what menu items were ordered.

|customer_id|order_date|product_id|
|-----------|----------|----------|
|A          |2021-01-01|1         |
|A          |2021-01-01|2         |
|A          |2021-01-07|2         |
|A          |2021-01-10|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|A          |2021-01-11|3         |
|B          |2021-01-01|2         |
|B          |2021-01-02|2         |
|B          |2021-01-04|1         |
|B          |2021-01-11|1         |
|B          |2021-01-16|3         |
|B          |2021-02-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-01|3         |
|C          |2021-01-07|3         |

 </details>

### **```menu```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The menu table maps the ```product_id``` to the actual ```product_name``` and price of each menu item.

|product_id |product_name|price     |
|-----------|------------|----------|
|1          |sushi       |10        |
|2          |curry       |15        |
|3          |ramen       |12        |

</details>

### **```members```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The final members table captures the ```join_date``` when a ```customer_id``` joined the beta version of the Danny‚Äôs Diner loyalty program.

|customer_id|join_date |
|-----------|----------|
|A          |1/7/2021  |
|B          |1/9/2021  |

 </details>

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Case Study Questions

1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

### **Q1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**
```sql
SELECT 
        customer_id, 
        SUM(price) AS total_price
FROM dbo.sales AS S
JOIN dbo.menu AS M
ON S.product_id = M.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

| customer_id | total_spent |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
