## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

### **```runner_orders```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

### **Data Issues**

Data issues in the existing schema include:

* **```customer_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
* **```runner_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
  - units manually entered in ```distance``` and ```duration``` columns

### **Data Cleaning**

**```customer_orders```**

Cleaning customer_orders
- Identify records with null or 'null' values
- Updating null or 'null' values to ''
- Blanks '' are not null because it indicates the customer asked for no extras or exclusions
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table

**```runner_orders```**

- pickup time, distance, duration is of the wrong type
- Records have nulls in these columns when the orders are cancelled
- Convert text 'null' to null values
- Units (km, minutes) need to be removed from distance and duration
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table


**Result:**

### **Q2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
```SQL 
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id, 
        c.order_time, 
        r.pickup_time, 
        DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS pickup_minutes
    FROM updated_customer_orders AS c
    JOIN updated_runner_orders AS r
      ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE r.distance != 0
    GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time
)
SELECT AVG(pickup_minutes) AS AVG
FROM CTE
WHERE pickup_minutes > 1;
```
| AVG |
|-----|
| 16  |

### **Q3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?**
```SQL
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT 
        c.order_id, 
        COUNT(c.order_id) AS pizza_order, 
        c.order_time,

        DATEDIFF(MINUTE, c.order_time, r.pickup_time) AS prep_time_minutes
    FROM updated_customer_orders AS c
    JOIN updated_runner_orders AS r
      ON c.order_id = r.order_id
    WHERE r.distance != 0
    GROUP BY c.order_id, c.order_time, r.pickup_time
)
SELECT 
    pizza_order,
    AVG(prep_time_minutes) AS AVG
FROM CTE
GROUP BY pizza_order;
```
| pizza_order | AVG |

### **Q4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?**
```SQL
SELECT 
  c.customer_id, 
  ROUND(AVG(r.distance),2) AS avg_distance
FROM updated_customer_orders AS c
JOIN updated_runner_orders AS r
  ON c.order_id = r.order_id
WHERE r.duration != 0

### **Q5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```SQL
SELECT 
    MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS delivery_time_difference
FROM updated_runner_orders
WHERE duration != 0;
```
| delivery_time_difference |
|-----|
| 30  |


### **Q6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?**
```SQL
SELECT 
  runner_id,
  c.order_id,
  COUNT(c.order_id) as pizza_count,
  distance,
  ROUND((r.distance/r.duration*60), 2) AS avg_speed
FROM updated_runner_orders AS r
JOIN updated_customer_orders AS c
  ON r.order_id = c.order_id
WHERE distance != 0
GROUP BY r.runner_id, c.customer_id, c.order_id, r.distance, r.duration
ORDER BY c.order_id;
```
| runner_id | order_id | pizza_count| distance| avg_speed|
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|----------|
| 1         | 1        | 1          | 20      | 37.5     |

### **Q7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?**
```SQL
SELECT 
  runner_id, 
  ROUND(100 * SUM(
    CASE WHEN distance = 0 THEN 0
    ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS success_perc
FROM updated_runner_orders
GROUP BY runner_id;
```
| runner_id | success_perc |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1         | 100          |
| 2         | 75           |
